# create-release-draft

Prepare the change log and create the release draft. The change log is created using labelled pull requests.  
The change log can have several sections. Each section can have a set of labels used to filter pull requests.

Process for creating the change log is:
1. We find the 2 commits associated with tag and prev_tag.
1. We find all the commits between the 2 commits.
1. We find all the pull requests that are associated with these commits.
1. We group the pull requests by label.
1. We sort the pull requests in each group by timestamp.
1. We create each line in each section using line = line_template(pull_request).

```
module.exports = {
    title_prefix: "My App ",
    // valid PR types: ['feat', 'fix', 'docs', 'style', 'refactor', 'perf', 'test', 'build', 'ci', 'chore', 'revert']
